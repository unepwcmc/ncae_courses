<p>The e-learning course is designed to provide an introduction to natural capital accounting, covering a range of concepts and methodologies. The modules are based on training materials produced to provide technical training to key stakeholders in Uganda. This course is aimed at those who want to know more about natural capital accounting and to understand how accounts are compiled and analysed.</p>

<p><b>Navigating the modules</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Each e-learning module will launch in your browser. Please use the arrows in the bottom right hand corner to move from one slide to the next, or back to the previous slide. Alternatively, you can use the headings in the navigation pane on the left-hand side to navigate directly to a slide of interest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Within each slide, there may be various interactive parts. You can click on any text that is underlined to take you to further information, either through a hyperlink to another webpage or a pop-up box within the slide. Click on blue boxes for further information on a given topic. Some slides have text boxes with scroll bars on the right-hand side – use these to scroll down to read the rest of the text.</p>   
<p></p>
<p>Some modules have one or more ‘knowledge reviews’, which are designed to test your knowledge based on the information provided in the module. On these slides, once you have completed the exercise, click on the ‘tick’ box in the bottom right hand corner to submit your answers and see if they are correct or incorrect. Knowledge review scores are not recorded, and you do not have to get the exercise correct before moving on, but of course we recommend you review any incorrect answers and perhaps revisit relevant slides. Some modules also contain ‘questions for reflection’. In these, you are encouraged to think about the question presented and what it means for your context. Again, your answers will not be recorded, so please do copy and paste your responses before navigating away from the slide if you would like to keep them.</p>

<p>Please note that Module 1 has an audio track which requires speakers or headphones.</p>
